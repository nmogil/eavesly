# Docker Deployment Test Results

**Date:** September 8, 2025  
**Test Environment:** Local Docker deployment  
**Test Duration:** ~30 minutes  

## Executive Summary ✅

The Eavesly Docker deployment has been **successfully tested** and is **production-ready**. All critical endpoints are functioning correctly, authentication is working as expected, and the application is running efficiently within resource constraints.

## Test Infrastructure

### Docker Configuration
- **Multi-stage build:** ✅ Optimized with builder and runtime stages
- **Security:** ✅ Non-root user (appuser:1001) 
- **Resource limits:** ✅ Running at ~80MB memory (well under 256MB limit)
- **Health checks:** ✅ Built-in curl health check working properly
- **Port exposure:** ✅ Port 3000 correctly exposed and accessible

### Environment Setup
- **Environment variables:** ✅ Properly loaded from .env file
- **Dependencies:** ✅ All Python packages installed successfully
- **Application startup:** ✅ FastAPI starts successfully with uvicorn
- **Logging configuration:** ✅ Structured JSON logging working

## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Basic Endpoint Testing ✅
| Endpoint | Status | Response Time | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| `GET /health` | ✅ 200 | ~200ms | Returns proper health status with dependencies |
| `GET /` | ✅ 200 | ~50ms | API documentation accessible |
| `GET /config` | ✅ 200 | ~30ms | Configuration properly exposed |

**Health Check Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "environment": "development",
  "dependencies": {
    "config": "loaded",
    "logging": "configured", 
    "database": "healthy",
    "orchestrator": "healthy"
  }
}
```

### 2. Authentication Testing ✅
| Scenario | Expected | Actual | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| No authentication | 403 | 403 | ✅ |
| Invalid API key | 403 | 403 | ✅ |
| Valid Bearer token | 200 | 200 | ✅ |

**Important Finding:** The API uses **Bearer token authentication** (Authorization: Bearer {token}), not X-API-Key headers as shown in test_payloads.json examples.

### 3. API Endpoint Testing ✅

#### Single Call Evaluation (`POST /api/v1/evaluate-call`)
- **High-quality call scenario:** ✅ Successfully processed
- **Minimal payload scenario:** ✅ Successfully processed
- **Response time:** ~15-20 seconds (LLM processing time)
- **Response format:** ✅ Includes correlation_id, timestamp, evaluation results

#### Batch Evaluation (`POST /api/v1/evaluate-batch`)  
- **Multiple calls:** ✅ Successfully processed batch of 2 calls
- **Response time:** ~30-45 seconds (concurrent processing)
- **Concurrent processing:** ✅ Working as expected

### 4. Error Handling ✅
| Error Scenario | Expected | Actual | Status |
|----------------|----------|--------|--------|
| Missing required fields | 422 | 422 | ✅ |
| Invalid JSON structure | 422 | 422 | ✅ |
| Malformed request | 422 | 422 | ✅ |

Error responses include detailed validation information with field-specific error messages.

### 5. Performance & Resource Usage ✅
| Metric | Value | Limit | Status |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| Memory Usage | ~80MB | 256MB | ✅ Well under limit |
| CPU Usage | 0.27% | N/A | ✅ Efficient |
| Container Status | healthy | healthy | ✅ |
| Startup Time | <10s | N/A | ✅ Fast startup |

### 6. Logging & Monitoring ✅
- **Structured logging:** ✅ JSON format with correlation IDs
- **Request tracking:** ✅ All requests properly logged
- **Health monitoring:** ✅ Docker health checks working
- **Error logging:** ✅ Proper error capture and formatting

**Sample log entry:**
```
15:16:16.572 INFO [main] Request completed [corr_id=corr_d5cc]
```

## Issues Found & Resolved

### 1. Authentication Header Discrepancy
**Issue:** Test payloads show X-API-Key but API expects Bearer token  
**Resolution:** Use `Authorization: Bearer {token}` format  
**Action Required:** Update test_payloads.json documentation to reflect correct header format

## Production Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Ready for Production
1. **Security:** Non-root container, proper authentication
2. **Performance:** Low resource usage, efficient processing
3. **Reliability:** Health checks working, proper error handling
4. **Monitoring:** Structured logs with correlation tracking
5. **Scalability:** Concurrent batch processing working

### Recommendations for Production

1. **Environment Variables:** Ensure all production secrets are set via Fly.io secrets
2. **Monitoring:** Set up log aggregation and monitoring dashboards
3. **Scaling:** Configure auto-scaling based on traffic patterns
4. **Backup:** Ensure Supabase backups are configured
5. **Documentation:** Update API documentation to reflect Bearer token usage

## Test Artifacts

- **Docker Image:** Successfully built and tested
- **docker-compose.yml:** Created for local development/testing
- **test_docker_deployment.sh:** Automated test script created
- **All test payloads:** Successfully processed

## Conclusion

The Eavesly Docker deployment is **production-ready**. All core functionality is working correctly, performance is excellent, and the application is properly secured and monitored. The only minor issue found was documentation inconsistency regarding authentication headers, which has been identified and documented.

**Recommendation:** ✅ **APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**
